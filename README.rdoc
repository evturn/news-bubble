Single Page Web Application that takes news articles via API that are related to sports and ranks keywords based on how often they show up.

Those keywords are then represented on the page in the form of bubbles. The larger in size, the more popular those keywords are.

Clicking on a bubble brings out a menu bar with all articles related to that topic. The user can click on the title of any article which will then slide out the article's description below. A link is provided which will take you to the full article.
